# Tunable-Keccak-Core
A tunable hardware design of Keccak (SHA-3) family of hash functions, implemented on FPGA.

The aim of this project is to provide a Runtime-Tunable hardware accelerator for KECCAK family of hash functions. 

The core features adjustable security and performance levels by tweaking the control unit timing to allow for variable Capacity and Bitrate values.
